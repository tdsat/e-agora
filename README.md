#e-agora

## What's this?
e-agora can be described as a state of the art cloud-based serverless no-sql 
blockchain consumer-to-consumer e-shop but it's what you get if you take a bunch of guys who had no experience
with PHP (or web development in general) and give them a couple of months to build an e-shop.

It is, in fact, a consumer-to-consumer e-shop (despite the fact that the code is more like a crime against humanity)
and it was created as the end-of-semester project for one of our classes.

I found it while going through some old files and decided to upload just because ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


## Features

#### Maturity

e-agora development started in 2012, so you know you have a battle-tested, mature product.
Sure, development also stopped in 2012 but that makes it even better because no development means no new bugs!

##### Stability

e-agora is extremely stable due to the simple fact that it won't even run 🎇

##### Backwards compatibility

e-agora is backwards compatible by design. In fact, it's ONLY backwards compatible. You need the `php_mysql` extension
 (and who knows what else) which was removed as of PHP 7. Yeah...

##### Ease of use

You don't need any build process, CI/CD or any of this fancy enterprise stuff. Just your trusted FTP (no SFTP please)
and you're good to go. And no more confusing `.env` files. All your passwords and other sensitive data are included
in the code (which also provides a slight performance boost. <sup>Probably<sub>Maybe...</sup>)

##### Extremely powerful search feature

The built-in search functionality allows users to tap into the power of SQL by not filtering the input at all!
Why limit them when you can be UNLIMITED!

##### Best-in-class templating engine

You can read about all the templating features [here](https://www.php.net/)


## Highlights

I was going to add some highlights but there are so many little things that it's hard to pick.
It's like a study in bad design (we actually tried following the MVC model. THAT didn't work out 🤣🤣)

From the curiously named `user2.php` file (what happened to `users.php` ?) to the 10+ parameter functions
or the super useful comments that warn you to be careful not to brake the database 
(because data validation is for losers). So many little gems. 

What's your favorite?

## TODO

* Translate greek comments to english so that you can fully appreciate the genius...ness of it all
* Dockerize it because why not lol
* Add licence

## Final notes

This was a trip down memory lane and if anybody ever reaches this page, I hope
you had fun at my misfortune. Yeah, it's shitty code and I'm happy I've grown enough
to realize that. 

PRs (lol) about the code will not be accepted. It's already perfect. For anything else (like 
making fun of me), be my guest.

Και αν γίνει κάποιο θαύμα και και κάποιος απο την ομάδα το δει αυτό τότε στείλτε 
μύνημα να τα κανονίσουμε να τα πούμε ρε αλάνια.

TEISER represent!
